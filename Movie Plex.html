            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">My Role: </span>I am in the process of designing an UI for a streaming website named Movie Plex.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Target Audience: </span>This UI have its main target audiences over the age of 65.</p> 
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Problem: </span>As so much bright UI with heavy text upsets the user and don't able to match up users expectations. Sometimes text over harsh colors made users uncomfortable to read the content. So while designing the UI's i have kept this things in mind. </p>
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;"> My Takeways: </span> I came up with the following conclusion
            <ul>
              <li>I should go with accesible and inclusive design as i have to design it in both modes so as it gives the user more comfort. </li>
          <li>For text-heavy screens, dark text with light background is preferred as default as it's legibility</li>
          <li>My semantic interpretation is- for messaging interfaces, light background with dark text is preferred as default.</li>
           <li>Health issues is the main concern for people who are suffering from headaches and migraine, Dark Mode preferred as default.</li> 
        <li>People who working for long hours such as software engineers who coded for long hours preferred Dark Mode UI as default. </li>
        
          </ul>
            
            </p>

<p>But in some situations some people preferred one mode instead of dark mode or some people raises their questions against it. 
  So I divided up my findings into two categories, the ones favoring a mode and the ones against it.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;"> My Approach: </span> After completion of my high fidelity mockups for the streaming site, I found that the designs in dark mode are more appealing.After completion of my high fidelity mockups for the streaming site, I found that the designs in dark mode are more appealing. So for my target audience i have designed the site in light and dark mode. 
              So, users can select the mode as per their preference. As well as i came up with the below following questions to make it more user-friendly.
            <ul>
              <li>Legibility (How readable is it?)</li>
               <li>Aesthetics (How beautiful is it?)</li>
                <li>Personal Preferences (Who prefers what?)</li>
               <li> Emotional effects (How does it affect emotions?)</li>
                <li>Semantic Interpretation (How does it affect understanding?)</li>
                <li>Visual fatigue (Which one makes the eye tired?)</li>
                <li>Technology benefits (Which one is technologically preferred?)</li>
                <li> Health conditions (Which one is better for health?)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;">Because of the pandemic restrictions, I was unable to do one to one user research to find out what the users prefer. But i asked some of my friends, relatives, college mates about their preferences so the following result has come up.
            </p>
            <img style="padding: 1rem;" src="assets/img/user findings.png" class="img-fluid">
       
            <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 30px;">Result:- </p>
    
     <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Legibility:
    
    <ul>
   
      <li> Dark text on light background more than light text on dark background preferred.</li>
       <li> The smaller the font, the better it is for users to see the text in light mode</li>
       <li> Higher luminance of light background leads to an improved perception of details.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>          

    <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Aesthetics:
   <li>I didn’t find any unbiased research on this issue. But based on my research, I can say most number of users preferred dark mode including people's who preferred the light mode version over dark mode. 
   </li>
</p>

<p> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 800;">Personal Preferences:</span>
  Research studies shows that dark themes are mostly used among the employees who working on computer screens, Even big tech companies plays an important role while forming preferences of their users. For example-
   <li>Jon Friedman (Head of Microsoft Office design) states one of his article is that cause of Customer choice Microsoft brought darker UI theme to desktop apps in office 2010, and also they brought more such experiences like Teams, due to its popularity.</li>
   <li>Even apple states that "Dark Mode makes it easier to stay focused on your work, because your content stands out while darkened controls and windows recede into the background"
    while approaching users with dark theme UI.</li>
  <li>Google states that dark theme has many benefits and provides guidelines for developers to utilize it on Android devices.</li>

</p>

<p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Emotional Effects: 
<li>Research studies shows that proficient color UI increases pleasure and preferable over harsh colors which negatively affects the mood swings and causes mood swings plus boredom.  Otherwise I didn’t find any study or enough feedback from users to come up any conclusion related emotional effects of dark/light UI.</li>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Semantic Interpretation: 
  <li> Research study shows that for chat interfaces, dark themes negatively compared to light themes as it causes the chances to send an ambiguous message. So for avoiding that most of the users prefer light theme UI on chat interfaces.</li> 
</p>


<p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Visual fatigue:
  <li>Research study by Nielsen Norman Group states that "there is no significant difference between dark and light themes in making people more tired". I feel some users who found the dark mode so disturbing and some users who found it a relief. Finding an affinity requires conducting academic research studies considering age, visual status, gender, etc.</li>
  </p>

<p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Technology:
<li>OLED screens display black by deactivating pixel elements altogether. This way, true deep blacks can be achieved without the consumption of any power and this is one of the main reasons many users mentioned for their use of dark themes. However, using any shades black (like dark gray) dissolves this benefit (i.e. not every dark mode design saves power!).</li>
  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Health: 
    <li>A research study confirms that near night-time, prolonged exposure to bright computer screens negatively affects sleep, circadian cycles and is known to cause headaches.</li>
    <li>Another one states that even though performance in light mode may be better in the short term, there may be a long-term cost associated with it</li>
    <li> But after talking with some of friends, relatives or family people's who're suffering from eye disease,visual problems or Migraine or headache found the dark mode more comfortable.</li>
    </p>
<p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 20px;">Final Conclusion:</p>
<p>This was a three-day exploration of the resources that I found on the internet and talk to my friends, relatives or family to know about their preferences. And finally i came to the final conclusion that using dark UI by many big tech companies are mostly concerned with marketing decisions and following trends.
  I feel it would be useful for designing interfaces on mobile devices and computer screens but not AR/VR environments as this field has lots of study to explore.
